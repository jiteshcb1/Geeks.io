          FRONTEND SECTION:In this section, we will use frontend technology like HTML (HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE), CSS (CASCADING STYLESHEET) and JavaScript through which user sees and interact in the browsers. JavaScript Frameworks will provide the core services for accuracy, flexibility and promote security
        </li>
        <li>
          DATABASE SECTION:In this database is used like MYSQL, for collection of information, store the data at time of registration and  enable the user to change the information so, it is simple to control of meeting attendees whether the attendees is an individual or group of attendees or any external attendees attended the meeting then the validate information should be provided.

This allows to access the information that our platform provides, if it has the value and it’s unique enough, this will generate awareness through API integration. 
        </li>
        <li>
          BACKEND SECTION:In this section, backend technology like PHP, JQUERY through this everything which happens on the backstage.it will contain all the information of the server where our webpages are there and this look after the functioning and processing of the website application.
